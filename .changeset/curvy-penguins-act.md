Drops support for Astro <= 5.0 and Tailwind <= 4.0

Tailwind CSS now offers a Vite plugin so this version of the integration is provided as a convenience if you're unable to upgrade to the Vite plugin at this time. Otherwise, we recommend you uninstall the integration and follow the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro).

Note the `nesting` option is removed as it's supported out of the box.
