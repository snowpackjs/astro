Deprecates the integration

This release doesn't change how the integration behaves. However, it deprecates it since Tailwind CSS now offers a Vite plugin which is the preferred way to use Tailwind 4 in Astro. If you want to migrate, uninstall `@astrojs/tailwind` and follow the [Tailwind documentation for manual installation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro).
