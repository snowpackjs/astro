Drops support for Astro <= 5.0 and Tailwind <= 4.0

The `nesting` option is removed as it's supported out of the box. We recommend you use the Vite plugin directly as documented in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides/astro) but this version allows you to migrate easily.
